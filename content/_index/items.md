subtitle= "In the Marine Predators Group, we use computational, lab, and field-based studies to address the scales of organization in the marine realm (from organism to ocean basin) that drive the pelagic ecosystems we depend on. While our work is rooted in oceanographic theory, we are driven to develop transformative approaches that seek to leverage fundamental biophysical interactions research to connect scientific inquiry to emerging ocean challenges, such as managing marine resources in a changing and dynamic ocean."
