Martini's primary research interest is the behavior and ecology of fishes in both marine and aquatic ecosystems. His current research in the [(Sub)mesoscale Group](http://submesoscale.org) at the UW Applied Physics Lab is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the influence of (sub)mesoscale oceanography on the distribution and movement of pelagic fishes. This research combines satellite telemetry in the Red Sea and fishery-dependent data from Hawaii to explore predator ecology, identify bycatch hotspots, and promote sustainable fisheries. During his PhD at UW SAFS, Martini studied the ecotypic differentiation of rainbow trout and life history diversity of salmonids in lakes. His other research interests include recreational and commercial fisheries management strategies, trophic ecology of protected species, parasite-host interactions, biological control of human diseases, and stable isotope methodologies.
