Aidan Cox is a third year Undergraduate in the Marine Biology department at the University of Washington. His research aspirations include quantifying deep-sea habitat use in marine predators to inform exploration and conservation. As a member of the Marine Predator Group, Aidan is responsible for analysis and visualization of pop-up satellite archival tag data. His current work involves quantifying surface use by North Atlantic swordfish to improve tagging approaches and technologies. These results inform study design and implementation of innovative technologies to explore how these predators interact with oceanographic features, including the deep ocean.
